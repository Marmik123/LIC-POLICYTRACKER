I developed this app using FLUTTER for my uncle who is working as an LIC Policy Advisor since 15 years. Since, he is working in LIC for such a long time he have a large number of policies and client data associated with him. He was maitaining the clients and their polcies details inside the VM PRO software in his PC.

So, to make that data portable and handy made this app for him.
NOTE: THERE IS NO LINK WITH APIs or with LIC database.

Using only local database by converting his entire VM PRO data consisting of approximately 4500 policiy details into a .db file (1.23 MB).

Flutter packages used :
1) sqflite - https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite
2) flutter_launch_icons - https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons
3) flutter_native_splash- https://pub.dev/packages?q=flutter+native+splash
